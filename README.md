# MrpixWeRepack
WeRePack integration for Shopware.

## Description
The Shopware 6 plugin mpXwerepack is part of the WeRePack.org initiative to avoid packaging waste and helps 
shop operators and their customers to save resources. To do this, the plugin adds a checkbox in the checkout 
that customers can use to give their consent to receive reused shipping packaging. So simple, so effective, 
so sustainable. In addition, you can motivate customers to protect the environment by giving them a small 
discount on their order. This can be credited to the current order, for example, or sent by e-mail in the 
form of a voucher code.

## Installation & Setup
1. Install & activate plugin
2. Create a new promotion
3. Select "Individual Promotion Code" for the promotion

5. Assign the promotion in the plugin configuration
